Galaxy Measurement Interpolation Methods:

In undertaking the challenge of amalgamating measurements of galaxies across diverse fields and wavelengths, I embarked on a methodical journey. Initially, I immersed myself in comprehending the intricacies of the data structures provided by astropy.io.fits, thereby gaining a profound understanding of their formats and contents.

I opted to leverage interpolation as the cornerstone technique for predicting measurements at desired wavelengths. In realizing this solution, I developed not only a robust "linear interpolation" function but also implemented "polynomial interpolation" to capture more complex relationships in the data. Moreover, I delved into the realm of deep learning, harnessing the power of PyTorch to construct "neural network architectures" capable of learning intricate patterns and relationships within the data for interpolation purposes. Additionally, I explored the versatility of "support vector regression model", showcasing adaptability in employing diverse modules to address the task at hand.

As a validation step, I meticulously evaluated each interpolation method, generating visualizations to illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques employed. These visual confirmations served as a testament to the efficacy and accuracy of the interpolation methodologies employed.
