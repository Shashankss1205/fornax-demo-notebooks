Key areas for improvement:

Error handling: 
I'll make sure to handle potential exceptions that may occur during data retrieval or processing. This ensures graceful handling of errors and prevents unexpected crashes, making the code more robust.
Parameter validation: 
I'll ensure that the num_samples parameter is valid, such as a non-negative integer greater than 5 and less than 500,000. This prevents invalid input from causing errors or unexpected behavior, enhancing the reliability of the function.
Scalability testing: 
I'll test the performance of both serial and Dask versions as num_samples increases by measuring execution time for different sample sizes
Resource management: 
I'll configure the cluster parameters, such as the number of workers and memory limits, based on the available resources and workload characteristics to maximize efficiency.
Code documentation: I'll add comments and docstrings for better code understanding.
Code refactoring: Improve code structure and eliminate redundancy for clarity and efficiency.
Testing: Conduct unit tests to validate code functionality under various scenarios.

Dask vs. Serial Performance:

Dask: Scales linearly with data size due to parallel processing across cores/machines. Ideal for large datasets and complex tasks.
Serial: Shows non-linear increase in execution time, suggesting bottlenecks. Less efficient for large workloads.

Key Dask advantages:

Scalability: Handles large datasets effectively by distributing tasks across multiple resources.
Efficiency: Utilizes resources optimally through parallelization, leading to faster processing.
Ease of use: Provides a high-level interface for parallel computing, simplifying code implementation.

My question:

I would like to understand how factors like:

Number of worker nodes: Adding more worker nodes generally improves Dask's performance, allowing for more parallel processing.
Dataset size: Dask shines with larger datasets as the workload distribution becomes more effective.
Task complexity: Highly complex tasks benefit more from parallelization, leading to significant speedups with Dask.
